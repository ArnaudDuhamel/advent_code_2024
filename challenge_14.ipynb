    "For part 2 of the challenge, I was actually quite confused about the problem. I first thought that the easter egg would appear within the 100 first iteerations. So I printed the 100 iterations in a file and looked at them manually. I was not seeing anything that really looked like a christmas tree. But then I was also not sure what shape it would actually be. So I was even confused about what I should look for. And then I thought for a while that some of the iterations before 100 were the answers so I tried those. But then it was the wrong answer everytime. So then I was litterally stuck. Even focusing on it hard, not even an idea was coming up. So I looked for help on Reddit. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's when I saw comments that the answer was well abvoe 100. Then I reread the description and there was nothing mentioned about restricting it to 100 iterations. So ok. But then it was unthinkable for me to start looking at the print of the iterations manually. And I still wasn't even sure what the actual answer should look like. Other users were refering about an automated check to find the right iteration and I had no idea on how to proceed. Really no clue. Completely blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I looked in the comment some more and I dared to revealed a darkened text that basically revealed the answer. The user counted the amount of 3x3 clusters of non-empty positions. One user mentioned that it did not work for him. So then I decided to go with 2x2 clusters. The idea is that there would be a bunch of occupied positions next to each other when the easter egg would be displayed. And to maximize the amount of clusters, I went throug the list one index at a time. So that a cluster of 3x3 would return 2 2x2 clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "But then I didn't really have any idea of how many clusters would reveal the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I started to check for those clusters at every iteration. Most of them literally had no clusters. None. So I started ignoring those. For most iterations that had more then 0, they had between 1 and 3 clusters only. Not much. But then suddenly there was an iteration with 174 clusters. That was it. I had found it. I printed the outcome of that maze on file and say a full fledged christmas tree in a frame. Exactly what a christmas tree should look like. "
