    "For this implementation I struggled quite a lot. There was a lot of trial and error, but I did not look at a single line of code online. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first I thought that, as soon as I came out of a wall onto a path, everything had to stop. I misinterpreted the challenge here. But it turns out I was not the only one so I did not feel too bad about that. https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hifhct/2024_day_20_part_2_did_anyone_else_think_the/.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first step that I took was to be able to find all the positions around a block of obstacles. And it worked quite alright. I did it with a bfs pathfinding keep the shortest path. So, at every position of the main path, I was looking for blocks of obstacles and finding the other positions of the main path adjacent to it. I was then looking at the police cheats from the main path position to those others. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it was wrong. So then I thought I was missing something, and I could not figure out what. That's when I went online. I saw this Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hifhct/2024_day_20_part_2_did_anyone_else_think_the/. And then I realized I interpreted the problem in the wrong way. It was allowed to go from a wall to an open path position, and to a wall again. \n",
    "\n",
    "So then I went with a bfs pathfinding algorithm trying to find the shortest path to each point within a 20 points distance to the position I was starting from. And it seemed to work. When I was using the algorithm for any single position, it was working. But then when I started running the algorithtm from one position, then to the other, I was getting it wrong. The score was always the same for the different dots, and it should not be. That's when I realized that what was the shortest path prevented to reach other shortcuts, even the ones that would save more time. Because if a position had a higher score at the beginning, the path would die because a path with a lower score had passed there before. So this was not right. \n",
    "\n",
    "And then I rememmbered that I saw there https://dev.to/grantdotdev/advent-of-code-2024-day-20-race-condition-8pd that manhattan distance was used. So I tried to find a way to use this in the algorithm, but I really wasn't sure how to. I was kind of stuck there. At first I thought of using it in a pathfinding algorithm to find the cheats, but then I felt like it made no sense and that it was not really doable. What really did it for me was this quote in reddit:\n",
    "\n",
    "> It simply should have stated that:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> \"During the execution of a cheat, the program can enter and leave walls multiple times, as long as the cheat ends in normal track, within the maximal allowed cheat time of 20 picoseconds.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> The current phrasing:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> \"Cheats don't need to use all 20 picoseconds; cheats can last any amount of time up to and including 20 picoseconds (but can still only end when the program is on normal track). Any cheat time not used is lost; it can't be saved for another cheat later.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's when I understod that what mattered was to look at positions that were within a distance of 20 positions to the starting positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But somehow I was still stuck on the idea that I had to use a bfs pathfinding algorithm to see if a position could be reached by cheating. And this mistake was based on the assumption that I would lose a point only when going through a wall, but as the quote above explains it, it is wrong. You lose a point at every step you take. And this is why you can only reach any position by cheating if it is within 20 positions of the starting position.\n",
    "\n",
    "However now at this point, I had the right logic. So, for every starting position, I picked other positions that were within 20 positions from it and discared the positions that I had already walked on. But from there, I ran a BFS pathfinding algorith to see if I could reach the position by cheating. This was unnecessary, and it made the algorithm very much ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was just too slow for it to be a viable solution. So then I started looking for ways to optimize my algorithm. So I found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hv2fgv/2024_day_20_part_2_how_do_you_optimize_this_one/.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then I was doing everything that was mentioned in the Reddit. So I still thought about what I was missing there. That's when I thought that I did not need to run BFS to see if a position within 20 positions from my starting point was reachable. Because it just is. Either there are 20 obstacles on the way, just 1 one or none at all, the position is reachable. So I dropped that and I went significantly faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I ran that for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I got the answer, and it was the right answer. But then I looked at more ways to optimize. And I was using a list to store the cheats. Because cheats are unique, so I thought I had to make sure I was not counting a cheat more then one time. But then I thought that since I move to a different starting positions, all the cheats that I could find are unique. After removing that list, the algorithm runs and comes up with right answer under a minute or two. This is the final version here.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, as it turns out, this algorithm works for part 1, and is much more efficient then what I came up with because it does not use a bfs pathfinding algorithm for every potential cheat. To adapt it, you then only work with positions that are reachable within a distance of 2 positions from the starting position."
