    "The real difficulty lies in part 2. I tried for some time to figure it out only based on the explanation. I somehow thought that it might have a mathematical solution. But I really went nowhere. \n",

    "That's when I decided to look for ressources. The first one that I found was this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hgcuw8/2024_day_17_part_2_any_hints_folks/. I went through it many times to understand the mechanics. How the program behaved. And I managed to understand that after a while. But I still struggled to come up with a solution. This reddit was only about hints after all. Before moving on to a full fledged solution walkthrough, I tried a recursive algorithm. This failed. That's when I decided to move on to a full fledged walkthrough. \n",
