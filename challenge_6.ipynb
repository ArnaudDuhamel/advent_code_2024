And I read the problem many times. At some point I did figure out that I had to find positions. But I was still getting the wrong answer. I resigned myself to look for help online and I read that my solution was wrong because my algorith was placing obstacles on positions on which that guard had already walked on earlier. This invalidated the position, because the guard would have bumped into it earlier, and so the obstacle would not have the expected effect.\n",
